Day to day activities

My day to day activities is like, when logged in to the shift the first one hour will be getting hand off from the previous shift. These handoff  done by shiftleads in respective shifts. Like How many ops tasks are pending and what are the clients that are currently in migration and what is the status of each migration. And also how many live migration is on process.

Once handoff process completed, I will assign each task to my team accordingly and ensure all the task has been hand over to the concern persons.
If any doubts or any assistance required to the team I will assist on the issues and also provide KT on the new process  if anything updated.

Most of our client are migrating to cloud, So will keep monitoring  all the status of the migration that my team working and if any lag or issues will get into it and troubleshoot the issues accordingly.

For the Test migrations we used to provision the instance and required resources in aws using terraform modules and change the values accordingly to the requirements. and will keep track of those migrations and once it completed we will destory the resources.
